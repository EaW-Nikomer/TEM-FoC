# Tournament Edition Mod FoC Ideas

## Version 0.1

### Space:

#### General:

Geonosis: 
- ~~Fix team 1 spawn.~~

Hypori: 
- ~~Fix team 2 spawn.~~

Bespin: 
- ~~Fix team 2 right mine to be hit by station.~~

Coruscant: 
- ~~Remove gravity well generator.~~

#### Rebels:

Corellian Corvette:
- ~~Price reduced from 1800 to 1700. (Kinda useless compared to a Tartan or Crusader)~~
- ~~Build time reduced from 15 seconds to 14 seconds. (Kinda useless compared to a Tartan or Crusader)~~
- ~~Increase damage done to mining facilities by 10%. (Possibly 15%)~~

Nebulon B-Frigate: 
- ~~Increase the damage done to mining facilities by 10%.~~ (Biggest issue with Nebs is that they cost 2500 and have far more cost efficient counters than an Acclamator as well as killing mines slower)
- ~~Increase hardpoint health by 10% (Possibly 15%)~~

Han Solo: 
- ~~Increase damage done to mining facilities by 15% (Possibly 20%)~~
- ~~Build time decreased from 33 seconds to 29 seconds.~~ (Han is only good vs heroes, trying to make him more viable)

Y-Wing: 
- ~~Price reduction from 550 to 450 (Shitty bomber price lowered)~~
- ~~Make laser cannons rotating 360 degrees.~~
- ~~Buff Ion shot to disable an enemy ship for 1.3 seconds per shot (4 seconds total)~~

A-Wing: 
- ~~Buld time reduced from 18 seconds to 16 seconds.~~ (Not useful other than finding a Phantom so why not)
- ~~Increase damage reduction from lure ability from 30% to 45%.~~

Rogue Squadron: 
- ~~Moved from tech 4 to tech 2.~~ (Bad hero unit at tech 4 plus would give Rebels a cheaper alternative to help vs bombers)
- ~~Price reduced from 2500 to 1500.~~ (Costs way to much)
- ~~Build time reduced from 25 seconds to 18 seconds.~~ (Lmao)
- ~~Reduce damage taken from Seismic Charge by 30%.~~ (Probably to op but will nerf if so)
- ~~Increase damage of strike by 20% as well as removing speed bonus.~~ (Ability is trash due to pathing)
- ~~Increase base damage vs mining facilities by 10%~~ (Probably needs a bigger buff tbh)
- ~~Fix bug where if Wedge dies he loses hero status.~~

Ion Cannon: 
- (Bug) ~~Adjust hit marker for Cons Space Station so that it doesn’t miss.~~

#### Empire:

Boba Fett: 
- ~~Increase the damage done to mining facilities by 10% (Possibly 15%)~~
- ~~Build time decreased from 28 seconds to 26.~~ (Trying to make heroes useful in FoC)
- ~~Fix his animation where he locks onto someone and follows them even with the stop command.~~
   - Turn Rate reduced (5.0 > 4.0) to help with this

TIE Phantom: 
- ~~Decrease HP by 10%.~~
 
TIE Scout:
- ~~Increase cooldown on Sensor Ping.~~
- ~~Increase price from 275 to 300.~~

TIE Interceptor: 
- ~~Price increase from 550 to 600.~~ (Beats X-Wings 1v1 no upgrades, lore wise rivaled A-Wing, should cost more also will help with Empire having more credits)

Tartan: 
- ~~Price increase from 1700 to 1800.~~ (Best corvette in-game vs mines, needs to cost more)

Acclamator: 
- ~~Price increase from 2350 to 2400~~ (Best frigate overall in-game yet costs the least, needs to be nerfed in price)
- ~~Right turbolaser damage type corrected from Damage_Acclamator to Damage_Acclamator_TL~~ (God bless Petroglyph)

Hyper Velocity Gun: 
- (Bug) ~~Adjust hit marker for Cons Space Station so that it doesn’t miss.~~

#### Zann Consortium:

Diamond Boron Missile Turret: 
- Reduce amount of missiles fired to 3 or 4. (Obvious reasons)
- Reduce AOE by 15% (Obvious reasons)
- Reduce damage by 15% (Possibly 20 or 25%)
    - Diamond Missile Turret reworked with proper accuracy and larger min range

Crusader: 
- ~~Fix damage type against enemy space stations.~~ (Obvious reasons)

Star Viper: 
- Increase damage by 10% (Not sure about this yet, We decided against this)

Skipray:
- ~~Price reduced from 700 to 650.~~ (Too expensive as is)
- ~~Reduce the amount of ion bolts fired.~~ (Potentially remove them as well, it’s kinda dumb you can add 1 skipray with starvipers and win even harder)

Buzz Droids:
- ~~Reduce cooldown by 15%~~ (If we add a window of damage activation and nerf damage then cooldown should be reduced a little)
- ~~Reduce damage by 10%~~ (Obvious reasons)
- ~~Add a 1.8 second window before they begin to do damage.~~ (To help give people time to react to them)
- Prevent the use of buzz droids in nebulas. (If Possible needs to be fixed, Currently not possible)

Interceptor IV Frigate: 
- ~~Add an extra Missile turret hardpoint.~~ (Attempting to make this unit useful)
- ~~Reduce health of turret hardpoints by 10-15%~~ (Needs to be tweaked if given two of them)
- ~~Price reduced from 2400 to 2300.~~ (One reason people don’t buy it is because it’s too expensive, can revert back if missile buff on it makes it worth 2400)

Extort Cash Upgrade:
- ~~Increase the amount of credits given from 15% to 20%~~ (No reason they pay 200 more credits for less money since Rebels & Empire are 20%)

Zann Consortium Credit Rate:
- ~~Increase to 21.75 creds/sec per mine from 20.5 creds/sec per mine.~~ (To help balance the cost of units at tech 2)
    - Increased to 21.0 due to increased station income

Bossk:
- Change Bossk’s Sensor Jamming ability to go on full cooldown once clicked and have a duration of 20 seconds as well as a 45 second cooldown. (I hope I explained this one correctly, if not I can over voice chat)
    - Cooldown was reduced: 75 > 45sec
	   - Duration was reduced: 30 > 20sec
