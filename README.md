# Tournament Edition Mod FoC Ideas

## Version 0.1

### Space:

#### General:

Geonosis: 
- :heavy_check_mark: Fix team 1 spawn.

Hypori: 
- :heavy_check_mark: Fix team 2 spawn.

Bespin: 
- :heavy_check_mark: Fix team 2 right mine to be hit by station.

Coruscant: 
- :heavy_check_mark: Remove gravity well generator.

#### Rebels:

Corellian Corvette:
- :heavy_check_mark: Price reduced from 1800 to 1700. (Kinda useless compared to a Tartan or Crusader)
- :heavy_check_mark: Build time reduced from 15 seconds to 14 seconds. (Kinda useless compared to a Tartan or Crusader)
- :heavy_check_mark: Increase damage done to mining facilities by 10%. (Possibly 15%)

Nebulon B-Frigate: 
- :heavy_check_mark: Increase the damage done to mining facilities by 10%. 
    - Biggest issue with Nebs is that they cost 2500 and have far more cost efficient counters than an Acclamator as well as killing mines slower
- :heavy_check_mark: Increase hardpoint health by 10% (Possibly 15%)

Han Solo: 
- :heavy_check_mark: Increase damage done to mining facilities by 15% (Possibly 20%)
- :heavy_check_mark: Build time decreased from 33 seconds to 29 seconds. (Han is only good vs heroes, trying to make him more viable)

Y-Wing: 
- :heavy_check_mark: Price reduction from 550 to 450
- :heavy_check_mark: Make laser cannons rotating 360 degrees.
- :heavy_check_mark: Buff Ion shot to disable an enemy ship for 1.3 seconds per shot (4 seconds total)

A-Wing: 
- :heavy_check_mark: Build time reduced from 18 seconds to 16 seconds. (Not useful other than finding a Phantom so why not)
- :heavy_check_mark: Increase damage reduction from lure ability from 30% to 45%.

Rogue Squadron: 
- :heavy_check_mark: Moved from tech 4 to tech 2. (Bad hero unit at tech 4 plus would give Rebels a cheaper alternative to help vs bombers)
- :heavy_check_mark: Price reduced from 2500 to 1500. (Costs way to much)
- :heavy_check_mark: Build time reduced from 25 seconds to 18 seconds. 
- :heavy_check_mark: Reduce damage taken from Seismic Charge by 30%. (Probably to op but will nerf if so)
- :heavy_check_mark: Increase damage of strike by 20% as well as removing speed bonus. (Ability is trash due to pathing)
- :heavy_check_mark: Increase base damage vs mining facilities by 10% (Probably needs a bigger buff tbh)
- :heavy_check_mark: Fix bug where if Wedge dies he loses hero status.

Ion Cannon: 
- :heavy_check_mark::beetle: Adjust hit marker for Cons Space Station so that it doesn’t miss.

#### Empire:

Boba Fett: 
- :heavy_check_mark: Increase the damage done to mining facilities by 10% (Possibly 15%)
- :heavy_check_mark: Build time decreased from 28 seconds to 26. (Trying to make heroes useful in FoC)
- :heavy_check_mark: Fix his animation where he locks onto someone and follows them even with the stop command.
   - Turn Rate reduced (5.0 > 4.0) to help with this

TIE Phantom: 
- :heavy_check_mark: Decrease HP by 10%.
 
TIE Scout:
- :heavy_check_mark: Increase cooldown on Sensor Ping.
- :heavy_check_mark: Increase price from 275 to 300.

TIE Interceptor: 
- :heavy_check_mark: Price increase from 550 to 600. (Beats X-Wings 1v1 no upgrades, lore wise rivaled A-Wing, should cost more also will help with Empire having more credits)

Tartan: 
- :heavy_check_mark: Price increase from 1700 to 1800. (Best corvette in-game vs mines, needs to cost more)

Acclamator: 
- :heavy_check_mark: Price increase from 2350 to 2400 (Best frigate overall in-game yet costs the least, needs to be nerfed in price)
- :heavy_check_mark: Right turbolaser damage type corrected from Damage_Acclamator to Damage_Acclamator_TL

Hyper Velocity Gun: 
- :heavy_check_mark::beetle: Adjust hit marker for Cons Space Station so that it doesn’t miss.

#### Zann Consortium:

Diamond Boron Missile Turret: 
- :soon: Reduce amount of missiles fired to 3 or 4. (Obvious reasons)
- :soon: Reduce AOE by 15% (Obvious reasons)
- :soon: Reduce damage by 15% (Possibly 20 or 25%)
    - Diamond Missile Turret reworked with proper accuracy and larger min range

Crusader: 
- :heavy_check_mark: Fix damage type against enemy space stations. (Obvious reasons)

Star Viper: 
- :x: Increase damage by 10% (Not sure about this yet, We decided against this)

Skipray:
- :heavy_check_mark: Price reduced from 700 to 650. (Too expensive as is)
- :heavy_check_mark: Reduce the amount of ion bolts fired.
    - Potentially remove them as well, it’s kinda dumb you can add 1 skipray with starvipers and win even harder

Buzz Droids:
- :heavy_check_mark: Reduce cooldown by 15% (If we add a window of damage activation and nerf damage then cooldown should be reduced a little)
- :heavy_check_mark: Reduce damage by 10% (Obvious reasons)
- :heavy_check_mark: Add a 1.8 second window before they begin to do damage. (To help give people time to react to them)
- :beetle: Prevent the use of buzz droids in nebulas. (If Possible needs to be fixed, Currently not possible)

Interceptor IV Frigate: 
- :heavy_check_mark: Add an extra Missile turret hardpoint. (Attempting to make this unit useful)
- :heavy_check_mark: Reduce health of turret hardpoints by 10-15% (Needs to be tweaked if given two of them)
- :heavy_check_mark: Price reduced from 2400 to 2300. 
    - One reason people don’t buy it is because it’s too expensive, can revert back if missile buff on it makes it worth 2400

Extort Cash Upgrade:
- :heavy_check_mark: Increase the amount of credits given from 15% to 20% 
    - No reason they pay 200 more credits for less money since Rebels & Empire are 20%

Zann Consortium Credit Rate:
- :heavy_check_mark: Increase to 21.75 creds/sec per mine from 20.5 creds/sec per mine. (To help balance the cost of units at tech 2)
    - Increased to 21.0 due to increased station income

Bossk:
- :soon: Change Bossk’s Sensor Jamming ability to go on full cooldown once clicked and have a duration of 20 seconds as well as a 45 second cooldown. (I hope I explained this one correctly, if not I can over voice chat)
    - Cooldown was reduced: 75 > 45sec
	- Duration was reduced: 30 > 20sec
